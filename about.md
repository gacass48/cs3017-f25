# Gavin Cassidy

My name is Gavin Cassidy and I am a Senior Data Science Major and Sports and Exercise Science minor at St. Lawrence University. 
I work on campus as the Student Assistant Director of the Peterson Quantitative Resource Center, and as an Admissions Ambassador. 
I also serve as one of the Captains on our Varsity Squash Team.

## My hobbies

Some of my hobbies include golf and disc golf, as I frequent both courses on campus at St. Lawrence.
I also will occasionally show up to Club Ultimate Frisbee practices and games and enjoy the tossing around a disc.
